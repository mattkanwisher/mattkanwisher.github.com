My name is Matthew Kanwisher and this is my personal website. Here youâ€™ll find my musings about about [Go Programming](/category/golang/), [Scotch](/category/scotch/), and [Travel](/category/travel/) stuff.

I grew up and lived in Atlanta, GA for 24 years until I moved to New York in 2008. I'm currently off [Errplane](http://errplane.com)

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/kanwisher) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcampbell777) or at [matt@errplane.com](mailto:matt@errplane.com).
